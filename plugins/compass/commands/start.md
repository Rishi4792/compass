description: Start (or continue) the Compass contract-first build lifecycle — contract → review → plan → review → build → review → ship — with user-driven gates between every stage, real receipt-gated transitions, auto-pause when context runs low, and clean cross-session resume.

# /compass:start — the lifecycle orchestrator

Compass builds software **true to spec, with zero drift**. The contract is the invariant; every stage is checked against it. You sequence the skills, but **you never auto-advance** — each transition is a user-driven gate, AND each downstream stage runs a real script gate that blocks on missing proof.

> Namespaced invocations: `/compass:start`, `/compass:contract`, `/compass:review-contract`, `/compass:plan`, `/compass:review-plan`, `/compass:build`, `/compass:review-build`, `/compass:ship`. Resume with `/compass:resume`.

## State (file-based, resumable)
All in `.claude/builds/<slug>/`:
- `contract.md` — the versioned locked invariant (amendments bump the version + re-lock).
- `plan.md` — the step checklist; its checkboxes are the **authoritative** build-progress record.
- `review-ledger.md` — issues across all reviews (first review creates it).
- `progress.md` — the cursor: status ∈ `{draft, in-review (Rn), contract-LOCKED, plan-LOCKED, CLOSED, SHIPPED, ROLLED-BACK}`. Reviews set `in-review (Rn)` at their START.
- `receipts.md` — each stage's **receipt** (commands + outputs). **The teeth:** every downstream Step-0 runs `compass.sh gate <build-dir> <prior-stage>`, which exits non-zero — a hard, un-skippable error — if the prior receipt is absent, FAIL, has an unchecked `[ ]`, or is SUPERSEDED. Escalation/re-run calls `compass.sh supersede` to void downstream receipts so they must re-run.

**`.claude/builds/CURRENT`** = a non-authoritative *hint* of the last active slug (cleared on CLOSE). With parallel builds it can NOT disambiguate — resume derives identity from the worktree (see resume). **`.claude/builds/INDEX`** = every build (`slug · goal · status · facets · touches`). Plan rewrites `touches` with the real file list from Phase 0; before planning, if another in-flight build's `touches` overlap, **surface it and ask**.

> **State path:** skills resolve state via `compass.sh state-root` (returns the *main checkout's* `.claude/builds`), so a skill running inside a build's worktree still reaches the one canonical state. Never hardcode `.claude/builds` from inside a worktree.

## Parallel builds (worktree isolation — the keystone)
A repo may run **N builds at once** (incl. one unattended). The rule: **one git worktree per build**, so no two builds share a working directory (this is what stops one build's `git add -A` sweeping another's files). Auto-on when `compass.sh active-builds` shows another in-flight build (or `--parallel`); single-build runs stay in the main checkout unchanged.

On `start` in parallel mode:
1. `compass.sh gc` — sweep terminal-build worktrees first.
2. If another build is active **and still in the main checkout**, `compass.sh promote <that-slug>` BEFORE starting the new one (never leave the first build in the shared checkout on a prose warning).
3. **DB isolation gate:** if this build changes schema, the contract MUST declare `isolation.db_provision`/`db_teardown` (per-worktree DATABASE_URL). `compass.sh check-db-isolation <slug> <has-schema:0|1> <provision-declared:0|1>` REFUSES a schema-touching parallel build with no isolation — concurrent migrations on one dev DB corrupt it.
4. `compass.sh worktree <slug>` → its folder+branch (runs `db_provision` if declared); `compass.sh install-guard` (once); then `claim` at build start. **ALWAYS create worktrees this way — NEVER hand-roll `git worktree add`** (that scatters ad-hoc siblings the guard/GC/doctor don't track). Worktrees live in the centralized home `~/.compass/worktrees/<project-id>/<slug>` (v0.6.0) — out of the project's parent, so the project folder is never confused with a sibling.
5. Tell the user the worktree path + the one-time `npm ci` / `source .env.compass` step, and that **all build work happens in that worktree** (`cd` there).
6. **See what else is in flight:** `compass.sh builds` lists every parallel build on this repo. Run `compass.sh doctor` anytime to audit/clean worktrees. **If a sibling merges first, every other build must pass `compass.sh post-merge-check <slug>` (and ship's merged-recon) before it can ship** — base-advanced + blast-radius vs `origin/<base>`.

**Unattended runs** (`--unattended`): gates write the resume banner and `exit 0` instead of asking; a guard rejection writes a receipt **FAIL** and stops (never retries → no livelock). Only proceed when the prior stage receipt is PASS.

## Autonomous mode (`--auto`, v0.10.0) — opt-in, two human gates only
`/compass:start --auto` runs the lifecycle WITHOUT the per-hop 4-button gate, stopping for a human at only **two** points (the rest auto-advance). It is mutually exclusive with `--unattended` (`compass.sh auto-precheck` refuses both; default = fully gated). Setup once at the start: `compass.sh budget-init <dir> [--wall S --sessions N --stages N]` (defaults 3600s / 6 / 40) then `compass.sh auto-init <dir>` (refuses without a budget — **a budget is mandatory**, INV-3).

The orchestrator loop in `--auto`:
1. **Per stage, Step-0:** `compass.sh budget-check <dir> --bump-stage`. Non-zero → `compass.sh fire-g2 <dir> budget-stop` and STOP (the measurable ceiling is the runaway guard — INV-4).
2. Run the stage. If a stage's verify/INVARIANT FAILS, or a review caps un-converged → `compass.sh fire-g2 <dir> <reason>` and STOP.
3. After the stage gate PASSES: `compass.sh can-advance <dir>`. If it passes, **auto-advance (treat as Approve) — do NOT present the 4-button gate.** If it reports a gate, STOP.
4. **G1 (the only upfront human stop):** right after the contract receipt is PASS, present ONE approval of the contract + design/product intent (Approve/Amend). On approval, append a `gate-cleared` event and continue the loop.
5. **G2 (event-triggered):** any `fire-g2` writes a `gate-wait-G2` banner to `progress.md` and STOPs (exit non-zero) — it NEVER auto-resolves, spawns, or hangs. A human resumes with `/compass:resume <slug>` choosing ship-despite-miss / relax / keep-trying / abort (after `g2_fires` ≥ 3, keep-trying is withdrawn).
6. **End of lifecycle:** review-build records `auto-closed: two clean adversarial rounds + all INVARIANTs green` (NOT a faked human signature — `lifecycle-audit` G-L2 accepts this marker); ship then runs its FULL real verification (prod recon + route smoke). Any ship/prod-verify FAIL → `fire-g2`.

**Cross-session continuation (F6):** when context runs low and the owning session stops mid-`--auto`-build, the Stop hook (`compass.sh stop-guard`) auto-spawns a fresh `claude` running `/compass:resume <slug> --auto` (from `budget.env`/`session-chain.log` state) and lets this session exit — **only** if not at a gate (gate-lock absent — INV-6), single-flight holds (INV-5), and the session cap isn't reached (INV-7). Spend is bounded by the measurable budget across all spawned sessions. No human is needed for continuation; humans are needed only at G1/G2.

## The pipeline
```
① contract ─gate→ ② review-contract ─gate→ [contract-LOCKED]
   ─gate→ ③ plan ─gate→ ④ review-plan ─gate→ [plan-LOCKED]
   ─gate→ ⑤ build ─gate→ ⑥ review-build ─(human sign-off)→ [CLOSED]
   ─gate→ ⑦ ship (MANDATORY unless the contract carries `deploy: out-of-scope — <reason>`) → [SHIPPED]
```
- Reviews converge first: **light = one clean pass; full = two clean rounds** (caps R1=2, R2=3, R3=5). Cap un-converged escalates UP (and supersedes) — plan→contract, build→plan, contract→user — never fakes done.
- **review-build requires a human sign-off** on the receipt's command+output evidence before CLOSED.
- **Ship is mandatory (v0.7.0).** CLOSED is NOT a final resting state unless the contract waives deploy. The terminal-status guard (`compass.sh close` runs `lifecycle-audit CLOSED`; ship runs `lifecycle-audit SHIPPED`) and the **Stop hook** (`compass.sh stop-guard`, fires every time the agent tries to stop) block going quiet, skipping a gate, or forgetting ship while a build is mid-lifecycle. Enforcement is script + hook, not discretion.

## The gate (between every stage — owned by the stage, never auto-advance)
**The gate is owned by each stage's skill.** Every stage skill ends by presenting the canonical 4-button gate (the verbatim block below; single source: `shared/gate.md`, smoke-enforced). As the orchestrator you **sequence** the stages and advance only when the user picks **Approve** or **Amend** — you do **not** present a second gate of your own. "Show full artifact" is offered via the gate's **Other** option. On detected drift from `contract.md`, STOP and surface.

<!-- GATE:START -->
## Stage transition — the gate (fires on EVERY entry path)

This stage owns its own transition gate. Present it whether the stage was run standalone
(bare skill, e.g. `/build`), via the namespaced command (`/compass:build`), or sequenced by
`/compass:start`. The orchestrator does **not** present a second gate — the stage owns it.

1. First print the one-line **transition footer**, in exactly this shape:

   `✓ <this stage> PASSED — <one-line proof>.  Next: <next stage> · run \`/compass:<next stage>\`.`

   (For the terminal `ship` stage, Next is `done — build SHIPPED`.)

2. Then present the gate using **AskUserQuestion** with exactly these **4 options**
   (AskUserQuestion caps at 4; "Show full artifact" is offered via the auto-provided **Other**,
   or just print the artifact if the user asks):
   - **Approve & continue** — advance to the next stage.
   - **Revise** — re-run this stage with the user's change.
   - **Amend** — a legitimate scope change (not drift): bump the contract version + changelog,
     run a mini review-contract on the delta, `supersede` downstream, re-baseline.
   - **Pause here** — stop cleanly; write the resume pointer to `progress.md`.

Only **Approve** or **Amend** advances. **Never auto-invoke the next skill** — the gate ASKS;
it does not advance by itself. On any detected drift from `contract.md`, STOP and surface
instead of advancing.
<!-- GATE:END -->

## Standalone / budget
Each skill works alone and self-gates via `compass.sh gate` (missing proof = hard stop, never fabricated). If the contract set a **budget**, surface "approaching budget" and stop-with-summary rather than grinding to a cap.

## Clean stage transitions (never go quiet)
**A long build must never leave the user wondering where it is.** Every stage ends with a one-line **transition footer** before the gate, in this exact shape — what just passed, what's next, and the exact command:
```
✓ <stage> PASSED — <one-line proof>.  Next: <stage> · run `<exact command>`.
```
The stage's own skill then presents the gate after this footer (the footer is the first line of the gate block). After any pause/interrupt, `/compass:status` reprints this. Mid-build, surface step `k/n` after each step. Silence is a defect.

## Auto-pause
The pre-compact hook fires an *advisory* reminder only — it can't write for you and compaction can't be deferred. The real safety net is per-step discipline (progress.md fresh after each step; a box never checked before its verify passes; a build IN-PROGRESS receipt per step), so a lost compaction costs at most one step. On the hook OR **Pause**: write `progress.md` first, then print the **elegant hand-off — exactly one clean, copy-paste-ready fenced block and nothing interleaved** (the shell command to open the build, then the resume command):
```
cd "<abs PROJECT root, where .claude/ lives>" && claude
```
Then, on its own line, the command to run once Claude starts: `/compass:resume <slug>` — Stage `<stage>`, Next `<the single next action>`. Nothing else on those lines: the user copies the block clean into a new terminal.

## Bottom line
Read `CURRENT`, sequence the stages, gate every hop (script gate + the stage-owned 4-button user gate), keep the contract as the invariant, prove every "done" with a recorded command, require the human sign-off before CLOSED, and hand off cleanly when context ends.
